# Weather App
- A simple but styled (transitions, custom backgrounds, etc) Weather App created with React using the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) API. 
- The background image changes as the tempaerature changes & has a fade in and fade out transition using CSS.

### Enjoy! :wink:
